# Stock-Price-Prediction
Predict the price of particular stock by using different algorithms of Machine Learning  

##Approach##
*Here, we have taken the date data from 1 January,2016 to 31 July,2016 into a multidimension array X and considered that as a parameter for dependency of stock in market.  
*We have taken another 1-D matrix Y to store corresponding price  
*Through these, we have used linear regression to predict their corresponding dependency amount for stock.  
*Then we feed the data for the next five months and find corresponding predicted price.  
*We also found the error percentage there.  
*Then we take a date and find its predicted price.
